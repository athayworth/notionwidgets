# How To Add Weather And Quotes Widgets To Your Notion Workspace

## Step 1

### Weather Widget 
- Go to [weatherwidget.io](https://weatherwidget.io/) and customize the widget. 
- Change theme type to 'blank' in the themes tab. This will only remove the background color of the widget. 
- Customize the icons and the color as you like, and then click on "Get Code" and copy it to the clipboard. 
- Proceed to STEP 2.

### Quotes Widget
- Go to [Quotes Widget](https://www.calendarlabs.com/calendars/web-content/free-quotes-widget.php) and customize the widget. 
- Change widget background to (Light mode: #ffffff) or (Dark mode: #2f3437). 
- Do the same with Widget Border Color if you want to remove it. 
- Generate the code and copy it to the clipboard. 
- Proceed to STEP 2.

## Step 2

- With the widget code copied, open the [boilerplate file](boilerplate) and paste the code under the "<body>" tag 
- (If you are using default light mode of notion change the "background-color" to #ffffff. You'll find it under the <style> tag.)

- Now, copy the complete code and go to [htmlsave](https://htmlsave.com), paste the code in the box area, and click "submit to save". 
-You'll now see a link to your site above the code box. Copy and paste into Notion. Click on embed and voila!

Woot!
